            <h1>505 - Arctic Monkeys </h1>
            <h2> Letra:</h2>
            <p>I'm going back to 505<br>
                If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
                In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
                With your hands between your thighs<br>
                Stop and wait a sec<br>
                When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?<br>
                I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br>
                Or I did last time I checked<br>
                Not shy of a spark<br>
                The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark<br>
                Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark<br>
                The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start<br>
                I'm going back to 505<br>
                If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
                In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
                With your hands between your thighs<br>
                But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
                It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
                I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise<br>
                Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br>
                I'm going back to 505<br>
                If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
                In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
                With your hands between your thighs and a smile</p>

            <h1>Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High? - Arctic Monkeys</h1>
            <h2>Letra:</h2>
            <p>The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time<br>
                But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side<br>
                And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes<br>
                Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you<br>
                Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind<br>
                Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply<br>
                "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br>
                "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br>
                Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite<br>
                I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?<br>
                It's harder and harder to get you to listen<br>
                More I get through the gears<br>
                Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas<br>
                Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind<br>
                Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply<br>
                "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br>
                "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"<br>
                And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I<br>
                It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time<br>
                I haven't found all I was hopin' to find<br>
                You said you gotta be up in the mornin'<br>
                Gonna have an early night<br>
                And you're startin' to bore me, baby<br>
                Why'd you only call me when you're high?<br>
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br>
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br>
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"<br>
                "Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"</p>

            <h2>Letra:</h2>
            <p>Open Sesame<br>
                (We've places to go)<br>
                We've people to see<br>
                (Let's put 'em on hold)<br>
                There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make<br>
                When you want to escape, say the word<br>
                Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do<br>
                With the exception of you, I dislike everyone in the room<br>
                And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth<br>
                Get the sense that you're on the move<br>
                And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you<br>
                Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you<br>
                Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you<br>
                Eyes the colour of<br>

                Icing sugar dust<br>
                (Crazy green flashes)<br>
                It's a funny thing that I cannot explain<br>
                Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?<br>
                Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you<br>
                Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you<br>
                Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do<br>
                And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth<br>
                And I know we got places to go, we got people to see<br>
                Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree, yeah<br>
                Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you<br>
                Stop the world 'cause I wanna get off with you</p>
